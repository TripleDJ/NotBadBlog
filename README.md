React project was bootstrapped with Create React App.

There are two servers: Express server on port 5000 and create-react-app server on port 3000

First of all, after cloning this repo, go to server folder and type "npm install" in this directory to install all necesarry packages for node.js server

To start express server with nodemon (nodemon library auto-refreshes server when any changes in the project occurs):
"npm run server"

To start react server:
"npm run client"

To start both servers concurrently:
"npm run dev"
